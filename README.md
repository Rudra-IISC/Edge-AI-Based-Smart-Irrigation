# Edge AI-Based Smart Irrigation System

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent irrigation system leveraging edge AI to optimize water usage for [mention your target application, e.g., small farms, home gardens, seedling trays]. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W to host a machine learning model that analyzes soil moisture data from analog sensors and determines the precise irrigation needs. An ESP32 acts as a communication and control unit, receiving commands from the Pico via MQTT to activate a water pump through a relay module.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete Edge AI solution for precision irrigation in nursery crops. By leveraging long-term climate data and an on-device MLP model, the system accurately predicts crop water needs (ETc) in real-time. The integration of crop coefficients (e.g., onion $K_c$) and soil moisture feedback ensures that watering is neither excessive nor insufficient at any stage. In trials, the Pico W's MLP inference achieved approximately 97% accuracy ($R^2 \approx 0.97$) against FAO-56 benchmarks, validating the approach. The edge deployment (MLP code in MicroPython) is lightweight and runs without cloud dependency. Hardware such as the ESP32 pump controller and moisture sensors have been successfully combined with the AI model into a functional prototype.

Moving forward, the system can be extended with a user interface (LCD or app) for monitoring, additional sensors (e.g., temperature probes), or ensemble models for other crops. The modular software and complete documentation on GitHub make it straightforward for technical teams to replicate or customize the system. Overall, this work provides a blueprint for water-efficient, smart irrigation solutions that marry domain knowledge (FAO ETâ‚€, $K_c$) with modern edge AI techniques.
